excerpt from pgcert blog: 
Erin Manning ([whom I referred to in blog post 1](https://mmhrpgcert.myblog.arts.ac.uk/2024/04/30/disability-reflections-on-intersectionality-positionality/)) also has interesting reflections on whiteness. She connects whiteness to neurotypicality, demonstrating the intersectional impact here in relationship to structures of whiteness that impose a sense of what is normal, which impacts upon many other identities that cannot align within this structural ‘norm’.
