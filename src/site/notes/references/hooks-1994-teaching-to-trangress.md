chapter 11 - Language (teaching new worlds /new words)

This quote 'This is the oppressor's language yet I need it to talk to you' leads me directly to consider some of the ways in which people (students at uni for example) us large language models to assimilate into the system. [[published/LLM-in-academia\|LLM-in-academia]]

addressing the mythology that education is something that is ‘neutral’, in Chapter 3 hooks  discusses her experience in trying to tackle some of the challenges in fostering inclusive spaces that acknowledge the different backgrounds and lived experience within the space. She addresses this within the context of largely white institutions and refers to the trouble of ‘tokenism’ and laying the burden of making change on the marginalized communities themselves.  Crucially she speaks of the importance in the building of genuine connection, communication (and thus empathy). She states ‘to hear each other, to listen to one another, is an exercise in recognition. It also ensures that no student remains invisible in the classroom’.
