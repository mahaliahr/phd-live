Sicart advocates for a definition of play as an experience highly dependent upon and responsive to the fixed social structures in which it occurs. The originality of _Play Matters_ lies in its diversion from more traditional ideas of play being something that occurs within the temporal fantasy world of the user. Johan Huizinga (a famous play theorist) famously claimed that play is a non-serious activity that occurs within a suspended time and place. Although both theorists recognise play to be an intrinsically motivated and meaningful activity, Sicart departs from Huizinga’s view, believing that play is a deeply serious activity grounded in reality.
