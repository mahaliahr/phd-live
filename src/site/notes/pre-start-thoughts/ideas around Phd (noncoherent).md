Messy - different ways of communicating / existing

there are two branches of research that my masters thesis was beginning to open up:

1. Reality - what is reality / anything can be a reality. shared space, types of reality. 'Hybrid Space' / Networked Space

2. messiness - tech is material and tangible. strive for something imperfect/malleable that allows for nuance. Messiness in interactions. Nuance/viscerality/expression. Hacking ?? Allowing for novelty* - hacking
*agency, autonomy*
unpredictable and unexpected.

'Messiness' more in regards to the interactions or the structure of what you are trying to enable.

something about improvisation and the inherent imperfections of it

**Algorithms as a frame work you can break**

'Glitch' more about the aesthetic

playful/experimentation how does this fit into things?

---
joy . fairness . equity

how do I strive for what I believe in, within a rotten system?

**certain people have the privelege to play // Who has the privelege to play?**

art as privelege

the foundations (requirements) for play also equals safety (I read something about this in a paper)

making the familiar strange

--------
some current thoughts I have been having in regards to education (and existing within Academia)

- what is education moving forward? specifically in regards to technology (creative computing)
**- if AI can 'do everything' what is education for? surely creativity is the now the focus/needs to be the focus**
- is there a 'messy approach' to teaching / education
- what is messiness' connection to creativity / exploration / play?

------
what is messiness? How to define it exactly

Definition in my 2020 thesis:

Thoughts regarding this now:

------
why am I interested in technology? how did I end up in this position, what drew me here? 

Technology as magic (connection to wonder, play)

**learning - creativity - play 

**education & empowerment**
