in a world where 'AI can do everything' creativity and imagination become the vital and most inherent things that we could learn/teach. how can we use computational tools ot help build these skills. what can educational intitutions do to stay relevant?how can people outside of these institutes still feel this agency to be creative and imagination if automation takes away certain skills or the need to learn certain things

*i want to frame this all in imagination and failure - new frontiers and learning *



Title: Computational Tools and the Future of Learning: Teaching Creativity and Imagination in the Age of AI

Overview: In the age of significant AI development, creativity and imagination have become increasingly important skills that are essential for human advancement. This PhD proposal aims to explore how computational tools can be used to teach and build creativity and imagination, particularly in the field of education. It will investigate how the automation of certain skills and the changing landscape of the workforce affect the need to develop these skills.

Research Questions:

1.  How can computational tools be used to teach creativity and imagination in education?
2.  What role do educational institutions play in teaching and developing creativity and imagination in students?
3.  How can individuals outside of formal educational institutions be encouraged to develop their creativity and imagination in the age of automation?

Methodology: The proposed research will employ a mixed-methods approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. The study will begin with a systematic literature review of existing research on creativity and imagination, computational tools, and their applications in education. This will be followed by in-depth interviews with educators, students, and professionals in the field of creative computing to gather insights on the topic. Additionally, the study will conduct a survey of individuals outside of formal educational institutions to explore their perceptions and experiences with creativity and imagination in the age of automation.

Expected outcomes: This research aims to provide a better understanding of how computational tools can be used to teach creativity and imagination, as well as the role of educational institutions and individuals in developing these skills. The outcomes of this research will inform the development of educational programs and initiatives that aim to foster creativity and imagination, and ensure that individuals are equipped with the necessary skills to adapt to a changing workforce.


possible questions: 

How can creative computing be used to foster specific types of creativity and imagination, such as divergent thinking, improvisation, or empathy?

How can individuals and communities outside of educational institutions cultivate and develop creativity and imagination in response to the challenges and opportunities of AI development?

_Developing and evaluating new approaches to teaching creativity and imagination within the context of AI and creative computing._

_How can informal learning environments, such as museums, libraries, and community centers, utilize computational tools to foster creativity and imagination in learners in the age of significant AI development?__

**One way to focus the question further is to identify a specific aspect of creativity and imagination in the context of creative computing that you want to explore in your research. For example, you could focus on how to effectively teach creativity and imagination using specific computational tools or techniques, or how to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools in fostering creativity and imagination in different educational settings.
 
**Another approach is to identify a specific gap or challenge in the field of creative computing that you want to address. For example, you could investigate the limitations of current computational tools in fostering creativity and imagination, or explore how to design new tools that better support these skills.

**You could also consider focusing on a specific population or context, such as K-12 education or informal learning environments, and how creativity and imagination can be fostered through the use of computational tools in these settings.

**Overall, the key is to identify a clear and specific research question that is both novel and feasible within the scope of a PhD project.
