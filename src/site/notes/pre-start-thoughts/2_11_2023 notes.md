What is the actual impact I want to make ?


What is the actual position that I am taking with this work?
  

What is my driver?


(it's about inclusion, it’s about breaking open this idea of education, it’s something that can be self led (autodidactic) it’s against elitism, it encourages openness)


(is it a critic of institutions (yes, but how strong do I want that to come across))

Spec design reframes the environment in someway, worlding

Following my chat with Sandra from the storytelling institute, I don’t want the idea of speculative design to overshadow the work (even though it will inform it massively) 

This idea of a ‘playful methodology’ is the key, i am exploring what a ‘playful methodology’ might look like in the future, through employing that very same ‘playful methodology’ in my phd process. The ‘playful methodology’ will encompass different strands of research to inform it (play, embodied learning, speculative design). It’s inspired very much by the idea of the way children us play to learn how to be adults. 

Why would a ‘playful methodology’ be useful in the future ?

If a lot of knowledge work is outsourced to AI, what would we be learning to do? If an AI can support us in these ways, do we need to learn these things, how would we effectively learn? How do we work in tandem with these systems effectively? Rote teaching perhaps becomes irrelevant. This idea of a ‘possibility space’ for learning seem to be an interesting idea to explore.
  

*Something like a library (as possibility space)


scrawl reformed by AI: 

My motivation to undertake this research is rooted in the pursuit of creating a meaningful impact in the realm of education and learning. At its core, this work seeks to challenge existing educational paradigms, striving for greater inclusivity, self-directed learning, and the dissolution of elitist barriers. The driving force behind this research is the belief that education should be an open, accessible, and flexible pathway, encouraging lifelong learning. While it does hold a critical perspective on institutional education, the emphasis is on reimagining and reframing the educational environment.

The methodology I propose is at the heart of my motivation. A "playful methodology" serves as the guiding principle, and this research is an exploration of what such a methodology might look like in the future. Taking inspiration from how children use play to learn the complexities of adulthood, I envision a methodology that engages learners in immersive, playful, and open-ended experiences. The diverse strands of research, including play, embodied learning, and speculative design, inform this methodology.

As the educational landscape undergoes rapid transformation, the relevance of a "playful methodology" becomes increasingly apparent. With AI systems poised to assume knowledge-based tasks, the question arises: What should humans be learning? This research seeks to provide insights into learning that extends beyond rote teaching and explores the creation of "possibility spaces" for learning, where learners can develop skills essential for effective collaboration with AI systems, ultimately fostering creative, critical, and adaptable individuals.
