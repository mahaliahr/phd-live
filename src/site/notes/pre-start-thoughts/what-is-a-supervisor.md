Extracted from the [[published/ual-description-of-a-supervisor\|ual-description-of-a-supervisor]]in the PGR handbook 

_Formal supervision may consist of: 
* _Written comments or guidance on your work; 

* _Face-to-Face meetings, the venue and timing of these meetings is a matter of agreement between you and your supervisor(s); 
* _Telephone, email or Skype/Facetime or similar communication.

I am interested to directly explore the impacts of [[published/LLM-as-phd-supervisor\|LLM-as-phd-supervisor]] and [[published/LLM-as-personal-tutors\|LLM-as-personal-tutors]] through the phd research.

As such I want to further examine the traits of the supervisor to cross-reference against the ability of the LLM to fulfil or meet these needs
