**Contemporary Context  

In today's uncertain global landscape, education increasingly emphasises ‘21st-century skills’, championed by organisations like Battelle for Kids and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills. These skills encompass critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, and important life and literacy competencies (Battelle for Kids, 2019). Similarly, the UK's Institute of Imagination focuses on fostering these skills in children through interdisciplinary STEAM education, with a strong emphasis on play as a fundamental learning tool (Institute of Imagination, 2024). However, while these initiatives mainly target children, this research seeks to extend their principles to adult learners, guiding the project's focus on a 'playful' methodology. 

The emergence of large language models like ChatGPT prompts a re-evaluation of traditional learning and teaching methods (Hulick, 2023). With these models offering new ways to interface with and receive educational information, academic institutions face questions about their existing pedagogical structures and the role of educators within.

In this evolving landscape, there's a pressing need to rethink ways of learning. As AI integration becomes more pervasive, places of learning must offer more than being mere repositories of knowledge. They should encourage experiential engagement, practice, experimentation and personal growth.  

**Theoretical Context 

The research integrates speculative design, critical pedagogy, and AI, framed by Ian Bogost's concept of 'possibility spaces' from ‘Play Anything’ (2016), linking play with scientific and mathematical explorations where all potential solutions are explored without assuming outcomes (Bogost, 2016b, chap. 6). Speculative design, as defined by Dunne and Raby (2013), serves to envision alternative futures and provoke critical reflection on current educational practices. Concurrently, critical pedagogy, influenced by Freire (1970) and hooks (1994), guides the creation of dynamic and emancipatory educational spaces through dialogue and co-creation of knowledge, aligning with the project's goal of fostering 21st-century skills via participatory and playful methodologies. This approach underscores the need to address socio-political injustices in education, ensuring technological advancements serve as inclusive and transformative tools rather than perpetuating inequities. 

Theories of computational creativity, exemplified by McCormack and d'Inverno (2014), explore how AI systems simulate, augment, or replicate human creativity, generating novel ideas, artifacts and solutions. AI's capacity to analyse data, recognise patterns and generate creative outputs, suggest potential to enrich creativity in educational settings, offering new tools for artistic expression, problem-solving and innovative thinking. 

**Methodology 

Aligning with the research aims, speculative design will inform the methodology. Design probes and artifacts will be created, integrating existing AI technology where feasible to prototype scenarios. Visual representations, narratives, and physical props will facilitate discourse and participatory co-creation in workshops, especially where speculative exploration is hindered by current technological limitations. [[Autoethnography\|Autoethnography]] will reflect on both my experience teaching as a lecturer and studying as a PhD student, incorporating my learning journey into the research. Observations, interviews and focus groups will capture the experience and effectiveness of speculative methods in teaching contexts. Engagement will include learning communities at UAL and non-academic settings (such as South London Makerspace and Antiuniversity Now) ensuring more inclusivity and accessibility. 

Acknowledging the inherent contradiction of studying inclusion in higher education (Halabieh et al., 2022), this research critically examines existing structures and biases in institutions. Despite higher education's association with exclusivity, the aim is to explore the potential for inclusive learning environments within this context.
