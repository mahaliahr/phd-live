### About PhD-Live

**How it works**
PhD Live is built from my evolving collection of notes, managed locally in Obsidian
and published automatically as a living website.The system is based on an adapted version of the open-source Digital Garden Eleventy framework - a toolkit that transforms a folder of Markdown notes into a browsable, interlinked network of ideas.

I have built on this to support live tracking, session logging, and real-time reflection as part of my research workflow.

Each type of note serves a different role:
- Daily notes – timestamped fragments that capture spontaneous thoughts or actions
- Sessions – focused working periods marked by start and end times
- Posts – developed reflections or essays, often synthesised from earlier notes
- Milestones – project checkpoints and turning points along the PhD journey

These feed into a dynamic homepage that continuously updates to show:
What’s happening live now or today
The most recent posts and reflections
An interactive graph showing conceptual links between notes

All of this comes together to create a structure where thoughts and ideas grow over time instead of being replaced or forgotten. Unlike a traditional blog, this site does not present finished work, but an ecosystem of evolving connections.

The full source code and content structure live in the public repository:

**Why it exists**

This website forms part of my practice-based PhD at the Creative Computing Institute, UAL.
My research explores how generative AI is transforming learning and teaching and uses speculative design and imagination as a method in imagining new ways to engage with these systems. 

By designing this platform, I am exploring what it means to make research processes visible, inspired by my practice as a live coder, I was wondering 'what if you could "live code" a PhD', I believe in this new era of learning which is greatly shifted by the impacts of generative AI - **process becomes everything**.

This site therefore functions both as a tool and as a case study within my broader inquiry.

Rather than presenting polished outcomes, [[PhD-Live]] foregrounds the process of becoming:
- how ideas unfold, cross-pollinate, and sometimes fall apart.
- It is both archive and performance - an experimental rehearsal for what scholarship might look like when it becomes live, networked, and entangled with AI.

**In short**
- PhD Live is a public digital garden of my doctoral research, an ongoing, transparent performance of thought.
- It’s part website, part studio, part sketchbook:
- A place where fragments come together, connections emerge, and the process itself becomes the work.
