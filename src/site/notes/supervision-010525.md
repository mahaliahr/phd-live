send things through the team a week before:

- draft ethics form(s) 
- talk through plans for upcoming/in progress design interventions 
	- plan for [[interviewing-staff-at-CCI\|interviewing-staff-at-CCI]] about AI Literacy and what I hope to learn
	- next student cohort project
	- AI supervisor
- [[annotated-bib-plan-supervision-150425.canvas|annotated-bib-supervision-150425]] (to show thought progress and field beginning to be mapped, also to show relevant sources shaping my new directions)
- show Gantt chart

Projects:

**Workshops for incoming new student cohort about AI Literacy**
	inspired by the podcast episode from IBM about AI in Education [[references/ibm-2024-AI-in-education\|ibm-2024-AI-in-education]] I want to explore how we teach students to critically interact with AI when they use it. I want to encourage a movement away from the large corporations such as OpenAI and empower the student to work with LLM's in a local and more personalised way. 

I also want to engage the students with the idea of actively and imaginative speculating on the future of AI in education. Throughout the workshop I want to offer some visual/narrative prompts that can act as catalysts for discussion or participatory ideation. 

**CCI Staff interviews**
In order to prepare for the workshops I would like to have a series of conversations with members of staff across CCI about the concept of AI literacy and how they are conveying this to students. Currently I get a sense (from general comments and casual conversation) that AI use is mostly frowned uponand I would like to get a clearer understanding of this - and specifically dig into what staff think is our responsibility in regards to the ever growing prevalance of AI in industry.

**AI supervisor 'supervisor bot'**
I want to lean into the fear of 'AI taking our jobs'. I want to directly experiment with what an AI supervisor could offer to my learning process whilst doing the PhD. In line with ethical concerns regarding mega corporations suach as OpenAI and resultant privacy issues trying to envision alternate ways of interacting with this technology is vital. Currently advising or encouraging use of ChatGPT and similar in this context is problematic. This leads me down the rabbit hole of running local Large Language Models and I have this idea of enabling students (and me) to create custom Large Language Model

*in the realm of the more absurd/unhinged, I am also thinking about virtual pets as an inspiration, but also more generally how virtual / AI companionship has evolved over time. What is are the use cases that could be important beyond just 'information exchange' and traditional ideas of education purposes* 

From my research currently there are a number of implementations of similar projects that I draw inspiration from 
- Shell Game - Evan Ratcliff
- Illinois Chat 
- Open AI and Anthropic's work with Academic institutions 
- Roby 'Creative Director' Bot
Currently I am building a V1 prototype to start testing what is possible with my current hardware and technical provisions.
A brief discussion of the prototype:
	This prototype explores the potential of a LLM to act as a supervisor, by adopting a 'persona' and listening to conversations between the student (me) and my supervisors, acting as an additional supervisor offering feedback.  
	It will allow a local LLM to observe conversations and respond with helpful context, using voice (maybe) and text.  
	It does not aim to have an interface and won't be a fully robust usable application at this stage.

**Questions

1. student support fund (there seems to be a sperate one for CCI - what does this mean?) Can I apply to go to conferences if I am not presenting (main SSF seems to state this, but CCI one doesn't)

![cci ssf screenshot](/img/user/images/cci-ssf.png)

2. does the post-registration ethics form cover everything - like an umbrella ethics? For each study would I need to fill in a seperate ethics form
