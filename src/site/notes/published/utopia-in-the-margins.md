Le Guin has a very evocative quote:
'What kind of utopia can come out of these margins, negations, and obscurities?' p10
I am also interested in ways that we can exist in alternate ways within these bigger damaging structures. This links to [[my-positionality]] no doubt, but I also like the subversive playful quality of it, playing within the margins and the restrictive boundaries to generate something (hopefully) more hopeful and positive
