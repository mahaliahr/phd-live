[[diy-bot-creation]]

This is a small AI set up by OIO Studio. As a studio they call Roby their creative director - Roby helps them come up with new ideas, moderates their Discord community and runs it's own Instagram account. They have recently upgraded their system (oio news, 2024) and are planning to share the technical setup so more people can build their own locally hosted bots. 

For me this project is highly relevant and
as it indicates that running a local LLM is very much possible, and can be an intersting addiotion to the creative process. That is happening in a commercial setting, even though this project is speculative and playful at this point, I see this having great potential as a tool within creative processes that companies may well more commonly adopt, especially if run locally in more energy responsible ways, as OIO is attempting to do (oio news, 2024).

Also I like the fun and slightly wacky approach of dreaming up this bot creative director and giving it an identity, and giving it real and tangible responsibilities and influence within the company.
