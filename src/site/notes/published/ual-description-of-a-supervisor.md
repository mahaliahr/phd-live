**Extracted from the PGR handbook:**

Formal supervision may consist of:

- Written comments or guidance on your work;
- Face-to-Face meetings, the venue and timing of these meetings is a matter of agreement between you and your supervisor(s);
- Telephone, email or Skype/Facetime or similar communication.

Responsibilities of the Supervisory Team (Director of Studies and Co- Supervisors)

1. Meeting regularly with the student at the intervals agreed at the start of the research programme. The normal expectation for full-time students is that at least three formal (i.e. recorded) supervisions must take place each term. During key monitoring stages of the research such as registration and confirmation more regular contact is to be expected.
2. Ensuring that any discipline/health and safety policies are brought to the attention of the student and explained.
3. Discussing any hazards involved in the research work and how these can be dealt with, and ensuring that safety procedures are followed.
4. Responding promptly and constructively to written or practical work completed, within the timescale agreed at the start of the project.
5. When a student has an urgent need for advice or guidance, the supervisor should be able to provide it within a reasonable timescale that does not delay the student’s progress.
6. Drawing the student’s attention to the examination regulations for the presentation and examination of theses (including any practical work) and agreeing a timetable for completion at least a year before submission.
7. If the thesis requires corrections or re-examination the supervisory team will normally continue supervision unless there are difficulties between supervisor and student

In addition, students may reasonably expect all their supervisors to:

1. Treat them professionally.
2. Give early advice about the nature of research and the standard expected in order to achieve the degree for which the student is aiming.
3. Arrange a supervision meeting as soon as possible after enrolment. This would normally be within the first week for full-time students. For part-time students, this may take longer to arrange.
4. Ensure that the first meeting covers the areas set out in 2. above. If this is not possible, these areas should be covered in another way.
5. Provide advice on literature sources and other research resources available and provide some directed reading to facilitate discussion and form the basis of a contextual review.
6. Deal promptly and appropriately with any research problems.
7. Take an active role in introducing the student to meetings of learned societies, seminars, etc, and to other researchers or experts in the field or relevant artists and designers.
8. Where the student’s own creative work forms part of the research, and when adequate notice is given, every effort should be made by the supervisor to attend exhibitions, performances etc, or visit studios as appropriate.
9. Provide advice on the publication and/or exhibition of research work and on the public presentations about the research.
10. Put the student in touch with specialists inside or outside the University where the student’s work goes outside the supervisor’s expertise. If appropriate, the supervisor should recommend the appointment of such specialists as internal or external supervisors or advisors.
11. Provide both encouragement and positive advice as well as criticism and negative comment as appropriate.
