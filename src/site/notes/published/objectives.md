Critically examine the potential implications of AI on teaching and learning. 

- Use speculative design to envision and construct scenarios that explore alternative learning and pedagogical approaches situated in possible futures, addressing the critical need to imagine and design towards these alternatives in response to current socio-political and environmental injustices.  

- Embed AI technology into interfaces or novel devices to create interactive environments that serve as speculative representations of future learning infrastructures. 

- Develop practical experimentation within these 'possibility spaces’ to test and evaluate the effectiveness of these speculative tools within pedagogical practice.
