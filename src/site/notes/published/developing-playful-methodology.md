tying into [[RQ3-playful-methodology-as-way-to-speculate]]
**what does this mean and how will I action it?

core tenents of play that feed into research methods that I am interested in 
ie.
- [[autoethnography]]
- critical / [[speculative-design]]
- arts based [[research-methods]] (?)

core tenents of play (that I care about)
- multisensory
	- tactile
- imagination 
	- role play
- embodied
