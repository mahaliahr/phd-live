Kehinde Andrews reaffirms many of the points of systemic oppression[^1] in academia raised in [[references/garrett-2024-imagined-futures-of-racialised-phds\|garrett-2024-imagined-futures-of-racialised-phds]] he talks briefly about his experience in academia but crucially he talks about having to **play to the system to receive validation and acknowledgement, which is restrictive, meaning that it’s necessary to conform to the ‘norm’ in order to succeed.**
