I need to build up knowledge re. [[published/generative-AI\|generative-AI]] currently and where it might head in the future. What are plausible speculations and projections that we could make about the way the AI will progress - especially considering the money that is being lost (as of Summer 2024) after all the investments that have been made recently 

[[published/material-constraints-of-AI\|material-constraints-of-AI]]

currently (6/8/25) I was using chatGPT and noticed a new addition of how they are trying to 'improve' the service. I find some of these new additions disturbing as the are so generalising and seem to concentrating on making everything easier - in a learning and research context I think this is very problematic. It begins to reprogram our minds and break down our abliity to make cognitive links ourselves. In order for these companied to be financially viable, the need to provide a service, as there are so many companies competing inthe large language model space this becomes worse. Now a question I have is how an we popularise or make easier the ability for people to feel empowered to employ and deploy this technology themselves, in their own ultra personalised way?
