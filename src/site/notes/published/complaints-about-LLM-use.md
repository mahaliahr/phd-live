something that I keep seeing amongst academics at CCI (and a criticism shared by others more broadly) is complaints that chatGPT (and the like) is being used in lots of formal processes (job apps, essays etc.) but I think that disdain people feel about this needs to start to reflect more on the reasons why so many people are doing this. I think that this proves that the antiquated ways of validating someone's 'use' or 'merit' are not fit for purpose.
