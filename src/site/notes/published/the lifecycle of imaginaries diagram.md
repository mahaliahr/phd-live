Alternative or new configurations of the world are presented in the diagram attached across a variety of contexts. The diagram exemplifies that these alternate worlds can be presented across a variety of contexts, using diverse media and can be created for a multitude of different reasons. Speculations usually concentrate on one specific idea and expand it to imagine a different version of the world or they create new artefacts and evidence based on this altered reality. The direction of this exploration is guided by certain agendas or interests, which shape the imagined scenario (B in the diagram) with the goal of influencing parts of the future world (C in the diagram). p28
