Aligning with the research aims and [[published/RQ3-playful-methodology-as-way-to-speculate\|RQ3-playful-methodology-as-way-to-speculate]], [[published/speculative-design\|speculative-design]] will inform the methodology. 

Design probes and artifacts will be created, integrating existing AI technology where feasible to prototype scenarios (see: [[published/design-interventions\|design-interventions]]). Visual representations, narratives ([[published/visual-and-narrative-representations\|visual-and-narrative-representations]]), and physical props will facilitate discourse and participatory co-creation in workshops, especially where speculative exploration is hindered by current technological limitations. [[published/Autoethnography\|autoethnography]] will reflect on both my experience teaching as a lecturer and studying as a PhD student, incorporating my learning journey into the research. Observations, interviews and focus groups will capture the experience and effectiveness of speculative methods in teaching contexts. Engagement will include learning communities at UAL and non-academic settings (such as South London Makerspace and Antiuniversity Now) ensuring more inclusivity and accessibility.Â 

Acknowledging the inherent contradiction of studying inclusion in higher education (Halabieh et al., 2022), this research critically examines existing structures and biases in institutions. Despite higher education's association with exclusivity, the aim is to explore the potential for inclusive learning environments within this context.
