Link to Ethics forms [MSc-CC-LLM-Study](https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/m_henryrichards_arts_ac_uk/EkMs1qbMkTxIuOx030VetukB1785bZFQngINcUSqyt27kQ?e=FRtqrj)
** I will need to ask for further permission to use this in my PhD

I want to analyse and reflect on Large Language Model's capacity to be a learning aid within my research 

In terms of 'mapping my field'
Education is moving forward
Speculative 
Tech

Questions:

- if you get ethical clearance for one project, can you use the outcome/findings/material in another? _ie. interviews with staff for pgcert, can I use directly within the PhD?
-- data transfer consent form, ask the teaching team to fill in if I want to use content from PgCert

To do
Mapping territory, technology and speculative design
Annotated Bibliography 

--- 

- How to make the reading productive
	- come back to the research q's as guiding lights
	- if reading doesn't tie into the research q's - get rid 
	- annotated bib  - 300 - 400 words summary of what I read
- field diary 
	- tying into this the reading 
	- note my thoughts after I do things like interviews etc..
- what is the next milestone
	- mapping the territory (that can make in the future chapters)

Things to think about: 
How do people choose what AI tool to use? Esp. non-specialists
Who is the audience (for the PhD) - who am I talking too?

[[published/ethics\|ethics]] form - methods
	co-creation with students, how do the students not feel exploited? 
	open-source / massive platforms - ethics 

RNUAL Symposium - present on things that I want feedback on, WIP - doesn't need to be finished!
