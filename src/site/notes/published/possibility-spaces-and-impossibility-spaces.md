it feels that the conditions in which many work in Academia (and more broadly within society in late stage capitalism, in more specific terms[[the-effects-of-neoliberalism-on-higher-education]]) are impossibility spaces, wearing people down or making things extremely difficult to exist within. but in these impossibility spaces can we carve out possibility?
