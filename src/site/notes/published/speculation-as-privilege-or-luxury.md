'To speculate seems too difficult when our realities fluctuate so readily. To speculate is a privilege whilst our economies collapse and millions are left unemployed. To speculate is a
luxury whilst our healthcare systems falter leaving hundreds of thousands of people gasping for air. To speculate is a waste of time whilst our political systems are torn asunder leaving millions disenfranchised. So, how can we possibly speculate when times are so unstable? How do we imagine alternatives whilst we are struggling to cope with the here and now?' p168

I think this is an interesting and valid point of view. but alternately when you have nothing, imagining and speculating what could be can often be life sustaining. I think worth bearing in mind is the positionality of the authors, that id I believe quite privileged, whats the relation to speculating and imagining for minoritised groups, I believe it's incredibly important.
