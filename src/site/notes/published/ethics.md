Ethical considerations 
- co-creation with students, how do the students not feel exploited? 
- open-source / massive platforms - ethics 
- positionality of participants - do they / would they want to share this? How to ensure for safety

supervisor-bot  ==_The proposed research aims to explore how a large language model (LLM) might support my PhD research by offering support much like a traditional supervisor. Exploring the qualities and requirements of what makes a traditional supervisor, I will create a custom-built LLM, running on a local computer, that could participate in the supervisory activities. The project hopes to explore novel approaches to utilising AI to support learning and is also motivated by concerns around privacy and the power of big tech companies. By building and experimenting with this prototype, I hope to understand how students might create their own AI tools to support their learning in ethical, personal, and creative ways.

100 word summary of proposed research: 

using a methodology informed by speculative design, the research aims to prototype, imagine and envision new learning realities shaped by the influence of generative AI (Large Language Models) on higher education. my teaching practice and learning itself will be shaped by speculative experimentations and a testbed for trying new things. within my teaching process I will work with my cohort of students I will work with them to develop a critical AI literacy and give them a framework for building their own LLMs and learning interfaces or at least use the existing platforms with clarity on the implications, we will also work in participatory ways to imagine possible future and contexts of learning. for my phd learning process I will experiment with protoyping an ai supervisor bot that will work alongside my supervisory team and I will reflect and adapt to the impacts that this will have on my process. 


This research, grounded in speculative design, explores how generative AI (Large Language Models) may reshape higher education. My teaching practice will serve as an experimental space, where I will work collaboratively with students to build critical AI literacy and examine the use or creation of LLMs and learning interfaces. Through participatory methods, we will envision possible futures of education. As part of my PhD, I will prototype an AI 'Supervisor Bot' to work alongside my supervisory team, critically reflecting on how this intervention influences my research process, learning experience, and the broader academic context.

what will participants be asked to do (laymans terms)

students will be asked to engage in workshops where we collectively envision future learning contexts and critically engage with LLMs and what they offer in this space. I will work with them to develop frameworks for building local and closed LLMs that are more catered to their creative pratice. I will invite staff from UAL to share their views and stances in regards to generative AI in the learning context and how or what they are doing to navigate this new terrain. Participants outside of academia will be recruited to get alternative views on interacting with LLMs, not shaped by acadmeic frameworks or technological grounding (as such at the CCI)


~~LLM text Participants will be invited to take part in creative and discussion-based activities, such as workshops, group conversations, or short interviews. In some cases, they may help imagine or design new ways that artificial intelligence could be used in learning. University students may also explore or test AI tools during their coursework, with space to reflect on their experience. Staff and external participants may be asked to share their perspectives or participate in creative exercises related to learning and technology. All participation is voluntary, and individuals can choose how much they want to be involved, or withdraw at any time without penalty.
