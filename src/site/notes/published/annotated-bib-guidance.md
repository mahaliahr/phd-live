this is simply bibliography list with some notes.

- helpful as it provides supervisor with a quick overview of what you have reviewed so far and what you plan to review. which can help them to identify goals in your research and point you in new directions.
- gives (me) an ongoing tool to help track what you've read and what you haven't & what might be useful to look at in the future

the most simple annotated bib is an alphabetical list of all the sources (to date) that you've identified as useful to your project. Underneath each entry should be a **short paragraph summarising the source and noting how it is useful to the project**. You can indicate things you haven't reviewed yet, making note of why you think it will be useful.

prompts for writing annotated bib:
- what did you see, hear and learn?
- what further questions does the source raise?
relate this to your research question or your work more broadly
