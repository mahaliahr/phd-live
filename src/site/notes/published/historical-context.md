Traditional educational models often face criticism for their rigidity and failure to meet diverse student needs, often favouring rote memorisation over practical skills (Belas, 2019). 

Concurrently, technology has been significantly reshaping higher education since the mid-1990s, with a notable trajectory of EdTech integration, including E-Learning Platforms, blogs, online videos, and MOOCs (Weller, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased the adoption of online learning, with changes further catalysed by the proliferation of [[published/generative-AI\|generative-AI]] tools around the same time (Abunaseer, 2023). While these technologies offer new learning opportunities, their implementation always exists within existing structures of inequity (UNESCO, 2023). 

This historical trajectory of educational models and technological influence underscores the imperative to envision alternative future learning approaches. Speculative and critical design methods serve as valuable tools in this endeavour, facilitating exploration of potential future scenarios and critical examination of current contexts (Mitrović et al., 2021, p. 69).
