I like the way Filliou describes the need to ‘practice...natural imagination’ p20.  Imagination is not often thought of as something to practice.

this also relates to Ruha Benjamin's thought about imagination [[benjamin-2024-imagination]]

#### Thinking about Improv

In reading Sal Khan's book about AI in Education [[khan-2024-brave-new-words]]] , I was captured by a scenario that he laid out where ChatGPT (his bespoke version of the model Khanmigo) would collaborate in a game of 'yes and...' as a way to encourage creative writing. One, I think this is a really interesting idea, and two, I started to think about [[improv]] (which I have been thinking about trying for inspiration) and the fact that it is very generative and playful and seems to be a great activity for 'imagination practice'(whatever that actually is). I wonder if there is more to be learnt from improv that I could take as inspiration
