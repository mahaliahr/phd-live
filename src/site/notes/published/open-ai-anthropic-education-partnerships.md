'The education-focused version of the AI assistant will aim to provide students with personalized tutoring and study guides, while faculty will be able to use it for administrative work.' (Edwards, 2025)

The higher education market has become competitive for AI model makers, as Reuters notes. Last November, Google's DeepMind division [partnered with a London university](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/british-pm-opens-google-backed-ai-campus-inspire-students-2024-11-27/) to provide AI education and mentorship to teenage students. And in January, Google [invested $120 million](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-pushes-global-agenda-educate-workers-lawmakers-ai-2025-01-25/) in AI education programs and plans to introduce its Gemini model to students' school accounts.(Edwards, 2025) 

"AI can be genuinely useful for students and faculty, so ensuring access is a legitimate goal. But if universities outsource reasoning and writing to private firms, we may find that we’ve outsourced our whole raison-d’être," Underwood told Ars. In that way, it may seem counter-intuitive for a university that teaches students how to think critically and solve problems to rely on AI models to do some of the thinking for us.

However, while Underwood thinks AI can be potentially useful in education, he is also concerned about relying on proprietary closed AI models for the task. "It’s probably time to start supporting open source alternatives, like [Tülu 3](https://allenai.org/blog/tulu-3) from Allen AI," he said. (Edwards, 2025)

Reading both these articles highlights the fact that AI in academia is becoming more widespread - its also really interesting to see a strong push from these company to innovate in this area. However as raised in the ChatGPT article there is a real concern about relying on 'proprietarty closed AI models' and 'outsourcing reasoning and writing to private firms' (Edwards, 2025). These development make clear to me that there is a need  offer alternatives to these systems and explore the potential of open source and local AI setups. Especially as there is a lot interesting work happening with open source models.
