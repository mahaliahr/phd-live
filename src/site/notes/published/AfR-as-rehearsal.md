In conversation with my supervisor (31-01-2024 ), they mentioned 'the Application for Registration' is a rehearsal for later steps (such as confirmation), it struck me that this is interesting language to use to describe the process, with links to performativity  - ie. [[classroom as dramaturgical site]]? 

Can the PhD be a performance or have aspects of performativity? This connects to thoughts I'm having around play.
