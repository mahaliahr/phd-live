I didn't learn how to learn from school. 

So where did I learn it from?

Skimming through a reading [[published/oreilly-research-identity-threshold-concepts\|oreilly-research-identity-threshold-concepts]] for my pgcert I was struck about the process of learning/development on a phd and was thinking what if all learning took a shape like this? More self led with mentors (supervisors) to guides you on your way. I was educated in school and I wonder how successful that knowledge forward model actually is? I certainly didn't gain a love of learning from this - it started before, at home and arguably generated through play. 

An ecology of learning as laid out by O'Reilly in his paper [[published/oreilly-research-identity-threshold-concepts\|oreilly-research-identity-threshold-concepts]] is an interesting way to look at learning
