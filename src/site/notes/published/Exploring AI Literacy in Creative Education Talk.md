I attended a talk facilitated by UAL Teaching and Learning(**Navigating the Future: Exploring [[published/AI-literacy\|AI-literacy]] in Creative Education**Â with Mary Jacob -PGCTHE Coordinator, Lecturer in Learning & Teaching at Aberystwyth Uni), there were some interesting points raised.

_notes from lecture:

[[published/AI eroding trust between student and teacher\|AI eroding trust between student and teacher]]

[[published/shift from product to process\|shift from product to process]]

[[published/motivation-and-engagement\|motivation-and-engagement]]

Question from David White

Question:
Are you having any conversations about impact of AI on Digital poverty? [[published/AI and digital poverty\|AI and digital poverty]]
