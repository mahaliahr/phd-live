random side note, but in a way it feels worth mentioning. My current obsession with making music (algorithmically) of course connects to my musician background but also is a way of expressing lots of feeling (with visuals as well), in a way it is in a sense world-building. I want to channel some of this joy and obsession into the 'art' ([[published/my-practice\|my-practice]]) of the PhD. I don't want the research of it to strangle the fun, play and exploration.
