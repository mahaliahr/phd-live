Now that we are in a time where generative AI can produce 'results' with 'ease'. The **process** of what we do becomes much more important. 
This is something that I am thinking about a lot and I believe will be an important element within the research.

tangential but perhaps useful thing that I am using at the moment to track my research that ties into the above idea:
[[published/digital-gardens\|digital-gardens]]
[[unpublished/zettelkasten\|zettelkasten]]

as part of [[published/my-practice\|my-practice]], I am also a live-coder. Live coding as a practice is very much about the practice of sharing your progress. This has led me to think about the idea - what isf I 'live code my PhD' - what would that look like?

perhaps collecting all of the places that I am developing work, like my github, obsidian, notion, youtube(?) and creating like a platform that this is being shared on. Or perhaps doing broadcasts or something? Need further thought, but I am really interested in exploring this.
