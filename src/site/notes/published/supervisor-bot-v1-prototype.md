This prototype explores the potential of a LLM to act as a supervisor, by adopting a 'persona' and listening to conversations between the student (me) and my supervisors, acting as an additional supervisor offering feedback.  

It will allow a local LLM to observe conversations and respond with helpful context, using voice (maybe) and text.  

It does not aim to have an interface and won't be a fully robust usable application at this stage.

from initial tests and work on this, I believe that the persona is too 'formal' at the moment, sounds very much like a bot and I think this might be jarring and weird in my supervisory meeting context (as I don't have that kind of very formal relationship with them, though obviously the context is still formal)
