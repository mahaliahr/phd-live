As far as my thoughts on [[published/diy-bot-creation\|diy-bot-creation]] this is a live version of this - thus this is not a new idea, the sooner that I can have my own usable open source customisable LLM chatbot for use in my research the better.

I wonder based on this tech setup if there is a looser framework that you can setup so that the students can have more automony in setting up their own LLM bot
