In today's uncertain global landscape, education increasingly emphasises ‘21st-century skills’, championed by organisations like Battelle for Kids and the Partnership for 21st Century Skills. These skills encompass critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, and important life and literacy competencies (Battelle for Kids, 2019). Similarly, the UK's Institute of Imagination focuses on fostering these skills in children through interdisciplinary STEAM education, with a strong emphasis on play as a fundamental learning tool (Institute of Imagination, 2024). However, while these initiatives mainly target children, this research seeks to extend their principles to adult learners, guiding the project's focus on a 'playful' methodology. 

The emergence of large language models like ChatGPT prompts a re-evaluation of traditional learning and teaching methods (Hulick, 2023). With these models offering new ways to interface with and receive educational information, academic institutions face questions about their existing pedagogical structures and the role of educators within.

In this evolving landscape, there's a pressing need to rethink ways of learning. As AI integration becomes more pervasive, places of learning must offer more than being mere repositories of knowledge. They should encourage experiential engagement, practice, experimentation and personal growth.
