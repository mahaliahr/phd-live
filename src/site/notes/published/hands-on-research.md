This book scaffolds really great guidance on how to conduct practice based research. It offers two really useful tools to help steer you through the research process and. One being 'the riddle' that helps you to constructively reflect on your work as it develops and the other being the 'circle model' that sets out the six core areas of hands on research pointing out that these six areas can be happening concurrently. Reading this has been really influence in helping me to be clearly about what my 'research by making' is and how to talk about my practice which is not always a straightforward thing to describe. 

'We describe research as an _articulated inquiry into questions and interests_. This implies an experimental and iterative process with an uncertain outcome, which is as much about experience and learning as it is about the production of knoledge' p.3 
I like this quote as it has me thinking about [[published/focus-on-process\|focus-on-process]] thoughts that I am having in regards to the phd research
