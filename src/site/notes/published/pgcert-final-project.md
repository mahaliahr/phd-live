##### Socio-economic Factors
Wider socio-economic factors appear to be having as much of an influence as the influence of AI (at the moment). It seems to me that these things will go very much hand in hand.
Issues that come up within the PgCert were: 
- admissions of students more for more financial reasons than them meeting any criteria for the course
- cohort sizes growing to absurdly large sizes, whilst space availability  doesn't expand or adjust to meet these needs.
- there seems to be a general 'marketisation' and commodification trend of higher education
##### GenAI Will Change Roles
Insights from my colleagues:
- There will need to be a shift from output oriented learning and assessment to process based 
- There will likely have to be a shift from content delivery to more of an 'experience design'
- Education as a craft may require more pedagogical expertise - moving from content specialists to holistic educators

##### Autoethnography
I feel as though I need to dive into this further with more research, and I am also interested in the various forms that this can take. Is there any precedent for more visual autoethnography?
