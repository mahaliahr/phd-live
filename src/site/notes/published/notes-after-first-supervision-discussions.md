Winnie:

Who is the audience (ie in research/academia - AI, HCI, Critical Arts etc)

Contextualise why this is important, what is not working at the moment (ie. too normative)

What is my unique contribution? (Methodological contribution? Through co-design, participatory design)

Betti:

Avoid a human vs machine narrative  - this needs to be nuanced

look to expand the literature around SD beyond Dunne and Raby. check Matt Ward's work. It is important to be critical of speculative design.  

In relation to Bogost's ‘playgrounds/possibility spaces’, check also the notion of 'elbow room' which somehow is the opposite, to create an interesting tension.  expand the literature around play e.g. homo Ludens?

can you be more specific about the learning communities? Foundation? UG? PG? which course/discipline? how many participants? how many sessions? etc etc

Re. Ethics - familiarise yourself as soon as possible with this, as the Ethical approval may be quite labour-intensive

wish list of interventions, what would I want to do? literature review begin
