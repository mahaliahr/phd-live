at the moment (29/01/2025) I am wondering how to connect all the thoughts that I am having into something cohesive. I am thinking to have about narrative threads and /or threads of speculation as the basis for offshoots and tangents - but that it all comes back to this basic narrative

Or as another grounding principle I am interested in coming back to the idea of space - [[published/possibility-spaces-and-impossibility-spaces\|possibility-spaces-and-impossibility-spaces]] either metaphorically of physically as the container for all the other thoughts that are spilling out.

Crucially I want to express this in ways beyond traditional modes, particularly visual/moving image as a way to engage people. This is something that I need to research further into in regards to [[published/research-methods\|research-methods]], I wonder if [[published/Autoethnography\|Autoethnography]] will allow me to explore this in some way?

democratisation of knowledge, beyond the borders of the the academy/institutions?
