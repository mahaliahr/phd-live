The relationship with the AI supervisor bot can be more 'intimate' in a sense that the human to human relationship. The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that there is no sense of judgement from this entity, it has limitless time and patience. In this sense would a student rely on the bot more? Is this bad?

perhaps in this use case, there could some added [[published/functionality-and-behaviour\|functionality-and-behaviour]] that a summary of the 'student to bot' interaction could be shared with the human supervisors, so that they would see some of the process and dialogue that happened without them there, which would allow them to give feedback that might be helpful.

something similar to this was mentioned in the [[references/case-study-shell-game\|case-study-shell-game]] podcast in the interview where a person opened up in the interview more to the AI bot than to the human counterpart, with the speculation being that the lack of judgement from the bot and that feeling of safety was the reason why

the 'shape'of the role of the supervisor bot could be amorphous, particularly if I am the one crafting and creating the bot - if the supervisor role extends and it becomes more of a 'assistant' bot, what does this mean - to go back to the point above about how the relationship with an AI supervisor might be more 'intimate' this means the this role is more involved and more exhaustive which is definitely a thing that a human probabaly wouldnt be willing to do
