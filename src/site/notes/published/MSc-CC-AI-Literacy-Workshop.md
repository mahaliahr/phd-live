This year for the new cohort of students (25/26) I want to take the opportunity to introduce and 'onboard' the students to think about AI in a more critical way, understand what they know or understand AI is, and try to 'unmask' some preconceived notions about it **before** students use it blindly within their learning.

It will also a moment to introduce my PhD research and give a wider context of what I am doing.

---
First session in first week (general)

Topics to potentially cover: 
- see who uses AI - are students aware and have they used LLM's (for example)
- opinions and imaginations of AI - explore people's perceptions 
- what is AI? Here I am interested to gain understanding of what students think
	- Define AI - give overview, talk about the 'wooliness' of the term AI
	- ~~(very) brief history?~~

Additional: introduce my research and the potential to be involved in research project(s) on the course.

- Possible activity - what does the large language model know about you? (Exposing privacy questions when using corporate AI tools)
	- [what-does-the-llm know-about-you](https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/m_henryrichards_arts_ac_uk/Documents/PhD%20Onedrive/AI%20Literacy%20Workshop/what-does-the-llm%20know-about-you.docx?d=w5601486d815144d68bc688500024f0ab&csf=1&web=1&e=ESNvGl)
