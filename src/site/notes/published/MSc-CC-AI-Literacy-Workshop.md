  'onboard' students, understand what they know/ opinions about AI and flag some
  issues that are important to bear in mind. It will also a moment to introduce
  my PhD research and give a wider context of what I am doing.

First session in first week (general)

Topics to potentially cover: 
- see who uses AI - are students aware and have they used LLM's (for example)
- opinions and imaginations of AI - explore people's perceptions 
- what is AI? Here I am interested to gain understanding of what students think
	- Define AI - give overview, talk about the 'wooliness' of the term AI
Additional: introduce my research and the potential to be involved in research project(s) on the course.

- Possible activity - what does the large language model know about you? (Exposing privacy questions when using corporate AI tools)
