Considerations -> everyone is very busy, will people have time to contribute? 
How to design it so that people feel inclined to do it, rather than being a burden?

### **things to find out:**

How are we across CCI, teaching AI literacy? What position are we taking?
How are we talking about AI to students? 
When do we talk about it first in the pedagogical process?
Opinions on AI integration in learning - positive or negative, if negative ask why
As educators do we have a responsibility to prepare students for this landscape

focus groups?
questionnaire?
~~observations~~ ethics form doesn't account for this, so will need to submit another for this/ work out if it's valuable or useful

### 1 - recruit / scope (questionnaire)

- I'll send a short survey (5â€“8 Qs) to staff, with the aim to:
    1. Map teaching roles, engagement, brief opinions re. AI.
    2. Recruit for interviews.

---

- Your role at CCI 
- What year groups/modules do you primarily work with? (short answer).
- How often do you discuss or use generative AI tools in your teaching?
- When (if at all) do you first introduce AI concepts to students in the learning process? 
- In one or two sentences, how would you describe your current view of AI in education? 
- What do you see as the main benefits and/or risks of using AI in teaching and learning? 
- Would you be willing to take part in a 30-45 minute interview?
- Would you like to receive a short summary of findings?

### 2 -semi-structured interviews

- 30-45 minute semi-structured interviews 
- ==can I offer participants _different modes of interview_ to be more accommodating to varying and busy schedules (shorter, online, asynchronous written responses)==

### 3 - analysis
- **Questionnaire data** -  simple descriptives (counts, word clouds for open comments).
- **Interviews** - thematic analysis.

Compare the two, to see what emerges
