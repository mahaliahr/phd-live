Considerations - everyone is very busy, will people have time to contribute? How to design it so that people feel inclined to do it, rather than being a burden?

**things to find out:

How are we across CCI, teaching AI literacy? 
How are we talking about AI? 
When do we talk about it first in the pedagogical process?
Opinions in AI integration in learning - positive or negative, if negative ask why

focus groups?
questionnaire?
~~observations~~ ethics form doesn't account for this, so will need to submit another for this/ work out if it's valuable or useful

**Main questions**
1. How is AI literacy taught across CCI?
2. How and when do staff introduce AI in the learning journey?
3. What are staff attitudes toward AI in learning (and why, esp. for concerns)?
4. What support, policies, or conditions enable/limit integration?

**Methods:**

- **Short questionnaire (5 questions).** Sent CCI-wide to map “where/when/how” AI shows up and to recruit interviewees.
-
		- I explicitly address AI literacy in my course / curriculum. _(Never → Often)_
		- Students are first encouraged to **use/discuss AI** in: _(pre-arrival / induction / early weeks / mid-term / capstone / not at all)_
		- My overall stance on AI in learning is: _(Very negative → Very positive)_
		- My biggest concern is: _(free-text, ≤120 chars)_
		- I’m willing to join a 20-min interview. _(Yes/No + email)_

- **Semi-structured interviews.** 20–30 minutes on Teams
- 
		- In your current modules, **where (if at all) do you introduce AI** (LLMs/tools) in the student journey? (week/time, mode)
		- **Why there?** (learning objectives, framing, risk/benefit balance)
		- How do you **define or teach “AI literacy”** for your students? (skills, epistemic framing, ethics)
		- **Talk me through a concrete activity** or assignment that involves AI. What worked/failed?
		- What **policies/practices** (formal or informal) shape how you use or avoid AI?
		- **Attitude check:** What’s exciting you? What worries you? _(If negative, gently probe for causes: assessment validity, equity, workload, policy, technical)_
		- What **support/resources** would meaningfully change your practice?
		- Are there **differences across cohorts** (UG/PG, disciplines, language backgrounds)?
		- If you’ve **avoided AI**, what would need to be true to reconsider?
		- Anything else I haven’t asked that matters here?
