#### OneDrive folder with work in progress: [__draft ethics content](https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/m_henryrichards_arts_ac_uk/En2EC8QI9MJLgIjr0UpgeJIB6qSr5UVXAFgrtSByi_9iMA?e=1cmR92)
current proposed research projects: 
- ~~student ai literacy workshops (make this just class? not special session)
- diy ai bot
- student focus groups
- supervisor bot 
- cci staff interviews 

~~questions?
-what is '15. detailed outline of the research project' ? (Can use AfR for basis)
-want to work with a people/ a group outside of academia, but I am not clear about exactly who they are yet - is this a major problem for the ethics form? 
-consent form project overview: general or specific?
-did I forget anything glaringly obvious on the form

### feedback from meeting

- more specific in regards to higher education (higher arts (interdisciplinary) education) or be specific CCI need to be very specific 
- you I rather than we
- take out external people for now, maybe a later thing (or maybe through groups attached to CCI, like Peckham DAZ)
- wider connections with the rest of UAL (need to try to make)
- approach to think about re. the research: exploratory work is broader, direct interventions and practice is in CCI
- add AI guidance for UAL - need to review 
- is there something that could trigger people and how do I mitigate it - give (more explicit) examples of potential risk?
- breakdown what participants are doing for each group of stakeholders. ie students, staff and supervisors - be very specific - then breakdown in risks etc like that in other sections of the form 
- be more specific about the students and staff  -- the cohort has a number of ? and aiming for a group size of ?
- possible risk to consider - what if no-one wants to participate?
- data -> will need to mention GDPR 
- how will I collect data from participants? important to think about this 
- send separate ethics form as not ready yet
- do contextual and exploratory first to submit in June
- build relationships and trust before recruiting the students into the project

~ [[published/ethics\|Ethics]] draft text 

**Tips for a good ethics application**

- Consider ethical implications at project design stage

- Factor-in sufficient time to gain all required approvals
	- Apply 3-6 months in advance of planned activity
	- Remember…clock stops while response to queries awaited from applicant

- Seek supervisor input for good quality application

- Supporting documentation must be good quality and appropriate
	- Protocol
	- Recruitment material
	- Participant information and consent documentation
	- Indicative topic guide for interview or survey questions

__Other considerations

- Debrief for participants
	- Signposting to additional information or support, if needed

- Recruitment – gatekeepers?

- Information to participants

- Consent process: appropriate to participant population

- Data management planning – UK GDPR and DPA

- Use of internet or social media in research ==??

- Involving young and vulnerable participants

- Applying research ethics in an international context -->
