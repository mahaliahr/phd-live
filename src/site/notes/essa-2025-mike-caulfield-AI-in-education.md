Essa, A. (2025) ‘Mike Caulfield: AI in Education (Episode 1)’, _AI-Learn Insights_, 7 July. Available at: [https://ailearninsights.substack.com/p/mike-caulfield-ai-as-a-tool-for-coreasoning](https://ailearninsights.substack.com/p/mike-caulfield-ai-as-a-tool-for-coreasoning) (Accessed: 7 February 2026).

Caulfield talks about LLM's as 'co-reasoning' tools. He likens it to how using maps doesn't stop your need to know geography, but that you need to learn more geography to understand the map.
