- 10:27 I have been thinking a lot about possible open source infrastructures for LLM's. Reading the [[hao-empire-of-AI-2025]] is quite harrowing to fully understand the lack of morality these large commercial platforms have. 
- But at the same time, I feel that we can't afford to let these companies dictate the ways in which these technologies get adapted, that to 'reject' AI is to allows the dominant narratives and narrow control these companies have to prevail, which is a very disturbing idea.

[[project-cci-ual-staff-interviews]] I have felt a bit aimless with the direction for this, but with the ideas around [[diy-bot-creation]] formulating, and my thoughts as I am reading 'Empire of AI'. I am feeling that the interviews can be around these themes more directly. Understanding people's stance more broadly and what they think about facilitating bespoke tools as pedagogical methods. Something to think about is how transferable the q's are from staff at CCI to staff more broadly at UAL
