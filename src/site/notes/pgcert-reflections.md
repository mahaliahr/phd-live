 Using the [[the-riddle-for-reflection\|the-riddle-for-reflection]] from 'hands on research'. The following are my reflections on the modules and final progect of the pgcert.

# Theories, Practices, Policies
### What I asked?

**Imagination microteach**
Can you foster imagination within object based learning?
we were asked to come up with a 20 min micro teach session - I chose to try and engage this with thoughts that I had been having on the phd around [[imagination-practice\|imagination-practice]] particulary in examining how adults can reconnect with this key skillset that feels really central and important in teaching for children, but loses focus once people reach adulthood. In the context of the phd, imagination is also a central component of the so called '21st century skills' which will become increasingly important - particularly with the shifts that AI is making in pedagogical
practice.

### What I did? 

**Imagination microteach**
I chose clay as the medium in which people would work, this was for it's tactile nature and inherent formlessness and therefore potential for open-ended exploration. I gave the group a ambiguous written prompt: 
	*‘a network of challenges and discoveries, where structures invite interaction, movement and shared experience.  Exploration and spontaneity is at the heart of this place.’*
and asked them to make something that responded to the description 


### What I found?

**Imagination microteach**
As part of the session at the end we had a 'reflection and sharing' session. Feedback from the participants showed that they overall enjoyed the tactile process of shaping the clay. The varied forms of what was made showed the richness of individual imagination. Some participants noted that they veered away from the description, focosing on their personal inspirations instead. Overall while rich imagination was on display, it turned out that it was perhaps too vague and that more strict constraints might have help direct them more in the task
 
### What I (don't) know?

**Imagination microteach**
the session was short, so would ened to be longer and maybe run a few more times with other groups to get more concrete findings. Argualby running this session with a group of creatives (teachers in arts) means they may have far more access and practice of connnnecting with thier imagination, running the session with people outside this sphere might garner much different results. It's hard to scaffold people to imagine 'anything', findings from this make me realise the true challenge of my original thoughts and I believe I need do more reading in this area to learn and inform myself more
